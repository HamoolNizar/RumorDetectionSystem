2550	Ferguson	Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road? LIE	RUMOR
2551	Ferguson	That was very "SLICK" of the Police Chief to create a narrative that #MikeBrown was a "suspect" in a robbery!  #Ferguson	RUMOR
2552	Ferguson	Let's be clear, #Ferguson PD never said Officer Darren Wilson was responding to robbery call before contact w/ #MikeBrown until today.	RUMOR

2554	Ferguson	7) #MikeBrown was approached for mouthing off to a cop (both  #Ferguson PD &amp; eyewitness testimonies reflect this). NOT as a robbery suspect	RUMOR
2555	Ferguson	Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.	RUMOR
2556	Ferguson	Because, of course, when someone commits a robbery they stroll down the middle of the street where everyone can see them. #Ferguson	RUMOR

2565	Ferguson	I personally don't trust St. Louis County PD, and I think they waited all this time to forge and falsify evidence. #Ferguson #MikeBrown	RUMOR
2566	Ferguson	Oh, a suspect in a robbery? That changes everything. Everyone knows summary execution is the penalty for suspicion of robbery #Ferguson	RUMOR
2567	Ferguson	Every time the police talk, their story changes. I hate it. #Ferguson	RUMOR

2570	Ferguson	So the angel Michael Brown who is 6'4" 290 is the robber of the convenience store! #Ferguson http://t.co/d81cQPHzbi	RUMOR
2571	Ferguson	#Ferguson police say robbery preceded the shooting of Michael Brown, Darren Wilson officer who killed the teen http://t.co/9gBemKbnOe	RUMOR
2572	Ferguson	The surveillance tape the police have on TV DOESNT even look like anything near Canfield Green apts. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson	RUMOR
2573	Ferguson	The info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/7hjBIrf1a3 #Ferguson #MikeBrown	RUMOR
2574	Ferguson	If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself? #Ferguson	RUMOR
2575	Ferguson	#Ferguson police hand out info to make Michael Brown seem like a thug. But nothing on how he was actually killed, interaction with officer.	RUMOR
2576	Ferguson	I'm NOT believing this story because I know how the police lie and will keep lying and will organize together AND LIE. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson	RUMOR
2577	Ferguson	It's not #MikeBrown in those #Ferguson police video stills. Not unless he changed his shoes after the robbery but before he met the officer.	RUMOR
2578	Ferguson	If Dorian Johnson is a suspect in a robbery that justified #DarrenWilson killing #MikeBrown, why hasn't Dorian been arrested? #Ferguson	RUMOR
2579	Ferguson	"Police in #Ferguson, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beat him."	RUMOR
2580	Ferguson	Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUp http://t.co/PHUofG7mJR	RUMOR
2581	Ferguson	Bottom line: cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk. You don't shoot robbery suspects. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2582	Ferguson	So police narrative in #Ferguson is unarmed teen suspected in unarmed robbery was shot to death. We've still got a problem, Chief.	RUMOR
2583	Ferguson	From a couple months back “@pemalevy: #Ferguson police beat innocent man, charged him with getting blood on uniforms http://t.co/AdwiSuXieB”	RUMOR
2584	Ferguson	#Ferguson Police apparently has a history of fabrication.  http://t.co/x1d3QTfEBx	RUMOR
2585	Ferguson	MORE: #Ferguson police chief identifies Darren Wilson as cop who shot Michael Brown http://t.co/Qojlgp8mlc http://t.co/mwZBmZjAst	RUMOR
2586	Ferguson	Being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process? No arrest. No trial. No conviction―just immediate execution. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2587	Ferguson	the police version is also that #MikeBrown approached the officer. But if he had JUST robbed a store, why approach police?? #Ferguson	RUMOR
2588	Ferguson	An observation from yrs in practice - if it takes you 5 days to get your story out &amp; it doesn't make sense, it's probably not true #Ferguson	RUMOR
2589	Ferguson	.....for a cover-up to be successful....you must first discredit the victim..... #Ferguson	RUMOR
2590	Ferguson	And I feel silly for pointing this out but... In America we don't have  executions by gunfire for alleged robberies. #Ferguson #MikeBrown	RUMOR
2591	Ferguson	So lets recap. No dashboard cam of the incident. But definitely photos of Michael Brown in a store. Funny how that happens #NMOS14 #Ferguson	RUMOR
2592	Ferguson	Cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos, giving the #Ferguson PD time to destroy and/or manufacture any "evidence" needed	RUMOR
2593	Ferguson	The police chief is a 5 star general in projection, imagination and deflection...took a week to hatch this theory #Ferguson	RUMOR
2594	Ferguson	Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrown teleport?	RUMOR
2595	Ferguson	#Ferguson PD charged a man w/ destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while they beat him: http://t.co/xq1X0Hf2C3	RUMOR
2596	Ferguson	basically #Ferguson PD did an opposition research dump on mike brown, and not their jobs	RUMOR
2597	Ferguson	Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing when he was laying on the street to the security footage? #Ferguson	RUMOR
2598	Ferguson	In 2009 #Ferguson PD beat a black man, then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms http://t.co/Y1QTm1BZyt http://t.co/KcuZ5VFMOn	RUMOR
2599	Ferguson	so #MikeBrown's hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right? #Ferguson http://t.co/2zu5sUH84S	RUMOR
2600	Ferguson	so if he was with #DorianJohnson at the robbery why wasn't he in custody? All media outlets interviewed him before the police #Ferguson	RUMOR
2601	Ferguson	2009: #Ferguson cops charged man with prop damage for bleeding on their uniforms during beating. Even that was false. http://t.co/YaCXTAF4J9	RUMOR
2602	Ferguson	The selective release of information by #Ferguson PD tells us nothing about the shooting. Instead appears to be a basic smear job.	RUMOR
2603	Ferguson	Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops valued a box of Swishers at nearly $50. Time to stop smokin I guess http://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc	RUMOR
2604	Ferguson	#Ferguson cops beat innocent man then charged him for bleeding on them: http://t.co/u1ot9Eh5Cq via @MichaelDalynyc http://t.co/AGJW2Pid1r	RUMOR
2605	Ferguson	This is simple: IF #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect, why didn’t #Ferguson police say that on DAY ONE? Why wait six days?	RUMOR
2606	Ferguson	#Ferguson PD releases robbery incident report smearing #MikeBrown but not shooting incident report. Did they think we wouldn’t notice?	RUMOR
2607	Ferguson	These surveillance images were taken at a convenience store 10 min. Before #MichaelBrown was shot Sat. #Ferguson http://t.co/mnReDcRfzz	RUMOR
2608	Ferguson	DARREN WILSON MURDERED AN UNARMED TEEN LEFT HIS BODY IN THE STREET FOR 4 HRS Anything else is irrelevant. #MikeBrown #Ferguson #CoverUp	RUMOR
2609	Ferguson	Let's not forget that even if Mike Brown did shoplift, that's not why police said he was stopped or why he was shot. #mikebrown #ferguson	RUMOR
2610	Ferguson	So basically #Ferguson PD hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about Darren Wilson to call Michael Brown a criminal #NMOS14	RUMOR
2611	Ferguson	#Ferguson Police"once charged a man w/destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms" while they beat him http://t.co/YaGwynB7dP	RUMOR
2612	Ferguson	If Mike Brown was engaged in a robbery before being shot, why isn't his alleged accomplice under arrest? #Ferguson http://t.co/upMLU4bbK4	RUMOR
2613	Ferguson	The surveillance photos, the police report, and this witness account. #Ferguson http://t.co/Sbx9tfA5FA http://t.co/JGgtaXYOxz	RUMOR
2614	Ferguson	So in 5mins mike brown shaved his head and changed his scandals to shoes. I think your being lied too #Ferguson http://t.co/GSaYdYUhJr	RUMOR
2615	Ferguson	Assuming #MichaelBrown and #DorianJohnson were involved in robbery, when can we expect President Obama's apology to the #Ferguson PD? #tcot	RUMOR
2616	Ferguson	Looks like #Ferguson PD spent their whole week on a smear campaign against #MikeBrown instead of investigating or being at all helpful.	RUMOR
2617	Ferguson	So a large Negro robbed a store and then the cops saw a large Negro. WHAT WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?!?! Perhaps not execute him. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2618	Ferguson	I'm not retweeting the pic of #MikeBrown's body, but evidently he lost the hat and changed his shoes and shorts. And lost ~40 lbs. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2619	Ferguson	Photos of alleged robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson (via police) http://t.co/gr83XTGO1t http://t.co/7V34OtGYcn	RUMOR
2620	Ferguson	Look at his arrive time on the report. This man was still in the store. Exlplain this. #Ferguson #FergusonShooting http://t.co/caOWNddXxa	RUMOR
2621	Ferguson	The other day I asked a manager at the #Ferguson Market if police had requested surveillance video. She said no.	RUMOR
2622	Ferguson	Cigarettes on Staten Island. Cigars in #Ferguson. Are these seriously enough to take a life?	RUMOR
2623	Ferguson	Witness to #Ferguson shooting atty confirms Brown took cigars from store.  Client told FBI he "did take cigarillos" http://t.co/j9BARBU0c7	RUMOR
2624	Ferguson	So in #Ferguson, robbing a convenience carries the death penalty. Got it.	RUMOR
2625	Ferguson	In 2009, #Ferguson PD had the wrong guy. Beat him. Then charged him w getting blood on their uniforms: http://t.co/UJ90B2QrUM	RUMOR

2718	Ferguson	WOW RT @themarkberman: "The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery," #Ferguson police chief says	RUMOR
2719	Ferguson	"I know his initial contact was not related to the robbery," #Ferguson chief says. "It was related to blocking the road."	RUMOR
2720	Ferguson	BOMBSHELL: #Ferguson chief says the police officer might not have even known about the robbery when he shot and killed Michael Brown.	RUMOR
2721	Ferguson	Chief Jackson: officer was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2722	Ferguson	Chief seems to make it very clear that shooter did NOT write an incident report. 5th Amendment. #Ferguson	RUMOR

2725	Ferguson	"The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery," #Ferguson Police Chief	RUMOR
2726	Ferguson	The #Ferguson police chief confirmed the stop of #MikeBrown had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged convenience store robbery.	RUMOR
2727	Ferguson	The officer who shot #MikeBrown did NOT know he was a suspect in a robbery, according to #Ferguson police chief. They were not related.	RUMOR
2728	Ferguson	This #Ferguson PD chief press conference is AMAZING... he just ADMITTED Darren Wilson stopped him bc of the jaywalking.	RUMOR
2729	Ferguson	Police chief said officer who shot Brown didn't know about any robbery #ferguson	RUMOR
2730	Ferguson	Exactly. Why release the video if stopping Mike Brown was not related to the robbery? JESUS CHRIST THIS IS BAD. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2731	Ferguson	Chief Jackson: The initial contact between Officer Darren Wilson and #MikeBrown was not related to the alleged robbery. #Ferguson	RUMOR
2732	Ferguson	Jackson says Brown was stopped because he was walking in the middle of the street. #Ferguson	RUMOR

2740	Ferguson	So Michael Brown was stopped for walking in the street. #ferguson	RUMOR
2741	Ferguson	Wow! What was the point of bring out the robbery footage today if it had nothing to do with Michael Brown being stopped? #Ferguson	RUMOR

2743	Ferguson	#Ferguson cops beat innocent man, then charged him with bleeding on their uniforms http://t.co/0jNyJYpdch #PoliceState	RUMOR
